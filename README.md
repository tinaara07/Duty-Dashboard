# Duty-Dashboard

This is a simple and functional duty dashboard application for managing project tasks. It allows users to add, edit, and track tasks, providing an overview of the project’s progress. Key features include drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between progress states, persistent storage for task data, and color-coded tasks based on deadlines.



Features

	•	Add New Tasks: Users can create individual tasks by specifying task details like name, description, deadline, and priority.

	•	Drag and Drop: Easily drag and drop tasks between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) to manage progress.

	•	Edit Task Details: Tasks can be updated at any time, allowing changes to task name, description, and deadline.

	•	Color-coded Tasks: Tasks are color-coded based on how close they are to their deadlines:

	•	white: Due date is far away

	•	Yellow: Approaching deadline

	•	Red: Deadline is past

	•	Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

	•	Persistent Data: Task data is stored locally, ensuring tasks remain intact after refreshing or reopening the browser.

	•	Local Storage: All task information is saved using local storage, meaning the app works offline and doesn’t require a server.
